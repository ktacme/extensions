# extensions

This is my first extension for Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/)

I'm aiming to create an extension to generate rudimentary roots and branches. I've looked into using Turtle but feel it might be worth breaking this down a bit more to get more granularity and control.

Current structure is:

Get some input variables
Generate a load of elements
Fancify them
Stroke to path
Points -> Union

Or something like that..

Interested to know if you have any thoughts!

Cheers

Keith
